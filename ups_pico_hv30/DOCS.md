# Home Assistant Add-on: UPS Pico HV3.0 FSSD

This addon implements the Pi Modules Hat UPS Pico safe shutdown system.

When a power cut occurs and the set time elapses, it triggers a safe shutdown of the system, protecting the data from possible corruption and, if it is configured, it will send an email with a notification of the event.

**Important: this addon is designed for gpio-used firmware**
